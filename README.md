# candyMuseumLandingPage


Hello All!

This is one of the better projects I have made. It is a delicious looking, responsive landing page for a non-existant "Museum of Candy". It implements clean HTML code, Bootstrap and Google fonts. I worked on this project while in Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp.
